IALab Core Framework
====================
This is the central repo for the IALab software, including **parsers** of various microscopy experiments, into **multidimensional and multichannel images**, and core code for **segmentation**, **measurement**, **export** of results and **display** of images and results .  Some example workflows are stored in the Examples directory.
